# Code for league of legends winner prediction from main project. 

## The code contains a number of models used to make predictions over lol battles. The following models are tests:
  1. Classical neural networks
  2. Convolutional neural networks
  3. Residual block neural networks
  4. Embedding neural networks
  5. Graph neural networks
  6. Heterogeneous graph neural networks

### main.py contains the final code used for the model and data creation
